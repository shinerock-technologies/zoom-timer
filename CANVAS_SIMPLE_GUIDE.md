# ✅ Canvas Feature - Simple & Working!

## What It Does

The Canvas button now shows a **fullscreen timer overlay** that you can share with meeting participants via Zoom's screen share.

## How to Use

### Step 1: Start a Timer

Create and start any timer in the app

### Step 2: Enable Canvas Mode

Click the **Canvas** button (top-right, turns blue)

### Step 3: Share Your Screen

1. In Zoom, click **Share Screen**
2. Select the browser window with the timer app
3. Click **Share**

### Step 4: Everyone Sees the Timer!

- Fullscreen black background
- Huge timer display
- Color changes as time runs out:
  - **Green** - Normal
  - **Orange** - Warning (25% left)
  - **Dark Orange** - Urgent (10% left)
  - **Red** - Critical (5% left, pulsing)

## To Exit Overlay Mode

Click **"Exit Overlay Mode"** button at the bottom, or click the Canvas button again

## Why This Works

Instead of trying to use complex Zoom drawing APIs (which aren't fully supported yet), this creates a simple fullscreen overlay that you share via screen share - much more reliable and works immediately!

## Perfect For

- ✅ Presentations with time limits
- ✅ Meeting agendas
- ✅ Workout sessions
- ✅ Pomodoro timers
- ✅ Any timed activity where everyone needs to see the countdown
